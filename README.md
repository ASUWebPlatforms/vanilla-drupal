# Vanilla Drupal 10 starter

## Introduction
This is a starter repo that relies on the asuwebplatforms/asu_drupal recipe to build out a "vanilla" ASU Drupal site.
## Requirements
- Composer 2
## Installation
Clone this repo with git and then run `composer install`. That will populate the codebase with an ASU base Drupal 10 instance. 
Drupal recipes are available in core starting with Drupal 10.3.x. This recipe is installed like any other recipe. See: https://www.drupal.org/project/distributions_recipes for further information.
